# Belly Button Diversity
![Alt text](/Images/most-common-taxa.jpg)

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

My tutor, Saad Khan, assisted me with this homework. We used code from previous homework as well as from plotly.com/javascript.
